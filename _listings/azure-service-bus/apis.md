description: Depend on Azure Service Bus when you need highly-reliable cloud messaging
  service between applications and services, even when one or more is offline. Available
  in every Azure region, this fully-managed service eliminates the burdens of server
  management and licensing. Asynchronous operations give you flexible, brokered messaging
  between client and server, along with structured first-in, first-out (FIFO) messaging,
  and publish/subscribe capabilitiesmdash;excellent for tasks like order processing.
